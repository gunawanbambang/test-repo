2020 is the year where I start to learn from the base again. Things that I didn't consider before like:
- programming
- web development
- basic database
- docker/container
- container orchestration
- automation

I was so frustated before to learn the hype technology like Ansible, AWS, CI/CD, K8s, Docker, Angular, without knowing that:
- it is useless to learn all this stuff when my foundation isn't solid
- things as simple like TCP handshake? what happen when you click enter in your browser? HTTP/S? protocol stacks? 4G EPS?
- and the basic foundation to learn DevOps is GOlang, Python, etc
- I should've learn algorithm, coding better in my Uni 

But don't worry, don't envy with other people achievement, when it's your, it's yours. 
God has prepared blessings for me, but I need to work on things within responsibilities to get all this to happen.
Btw forgot one thing, God is good!
